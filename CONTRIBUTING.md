# Contributing Guidelines ðŸš€

Welcome, team! ðŸŽ‰  
To keep our hackathon project clean, fast, and conflict-free, please follow these guidelines when contributing.

## 1. Workflow

1. **Always pull latest code before starting work**  
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   
2. **Create a new branch for your feature/bugfix**
   `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
   
4. **Do your work and commit often (with meaningful messages)**
   ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: add landing page"
   
5. Raise a Pull Request (PR)
PR title should be meaningful: e.g. feat: add login page.
Describe what you changed.
Request at least one teammate to review before merging.
